Happiness Is When
by William Arthur Ward

Happiness is our heritage when
Faith becomes our constant companion;
Self-discipline our tireless teacher;
Integrity our competent coach;
Truth our trusted tutor;
Discernment our careful critic;
Optimism our able advisor;
Goodness our gifted guide;
Beauty our infallible inspiration;
And love our blissful benediction.
